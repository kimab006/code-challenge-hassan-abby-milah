<p> If this world were mine
    Hey, Roman numeral seven, bae, drop it like it's hot
    If this world was mine, I'd take your dreams and make 'em multiply
    If this world was mine, I'd take your enemies in front of God
    Introduce 'em to that light, hit them strictly with that fire
    Fah-fah, fah-fah-fah, fah-fah, fah </p>
